# Falling-Blocks-game
This is my study project created on C++ to master language knowledge. This is console game. 
In this small project i was reinventing the bicycle using part of other tutorials on such like "Snake game" in console. In my head I had image of game-loop that was going until higher blocks reached it's "bottleneck". Scoring stacked blocks and little trick with array to rotate figure.
